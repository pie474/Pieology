I know the first 35 digits of π:
3.1415926535897932384626433832795028 I also know that π goes on forever.
I want to find out some properJes of π:
1.  How many times does each number(0,1,...,9) occur in a set number of digits of π and how the data changes if I use larger numbers of digits.
2.  How far apart the occurrences of each number are and what the paTerns are.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼HYPOTHESIS
I analyzed the first 35 digits of π I know. I found that 3 occurred more oYen than any other number and 0 occurred the least.
Based on this, my hypothesis is:
1.  Each number will occur a very different amount of Jmes than another.
2.  Some numbers (like 0) will occur much farther apart than other numbers.

PROCEDURE
1.  I used Google to find a python program that generates digits of π. The program is simple, but I don’t understand exactly how it works.
2.  I could copy this on Scratch ( an online programming language) and I did.
3.  I tested the Scratch program, but it was inaccurate aYer 46 digits of π.
4.  Because of this, I decided to stick with Python and learn more about it (thanks Devoxx4Kids!!)
￼￼￼￼￼￼5.  I added my own code to the program so it would also count how many of each number there were in a given number of digits of π.
6.  I also added code so it would find the distances between occurrences of each number. (My code writes this data to a comma separated value file which can be opened by Excel)
7.  AYer tesJng it, I ran experiments to generate data for 100, 1000, and 10000 digits of π
8.  Finally, I analyzed the results in Excel and generated some π charts to show the data.
